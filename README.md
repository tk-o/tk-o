- 🇵🇱 I'm from Poland 
- 🇦🇺 I'm based in Australia
- 🔭 I’m working with [@deployAt](https://github.com/deployAt/) and [@korzewski](https://github.com/korzewski/) on our common project [atomiklabs.io](https://www.atomiklabs.io)
- 🌱 I’m learning about Substrate ecosystem (blockchain solutions, smart-contracts, cryptography)
- 💬 Ask me about anything, or about growing from a hype-driven engineer to outcome-focused engineer
- 📫 How to reach me: [0xTko](https://twitter.com/0xTko) on Twitter
- ✍️ I've been writing [a blog on www.kopacki.net](https://www.kopacki.net/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wrote [a manifest to myself](https://github.com/tk-o/with-rust/blob/main/readme.md) to keep learning totally new things, even if I don't feel like doing it:
    > Habits and becoming proficient
    >
    > I strongly believe that becoming an expert in some field requires time and curiosity to be put it the area of interest.
    >
    > I also understand that to do something over time, I cannot rely on motivation. It comes and goes. What I have to rely on is a power of habit.
    > I am writing this to keep myself accountable in the times my motivation would want me to forget about going through the process, and give up. I won't give up.
    > 
    > Trust the process
    > 
    > I will spend at least 25 minutes, everyday, pushing my capabilities of capturing value with Rust programming language forward.
